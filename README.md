### About me ðŸ‘‹

Currently I do freelance work as a graphic designer;
at the moment I am studying English, Korean, Japanese;
I'm a student at GROWDEV, in the UX/UI designer starter program;
I'm a person who loves to learn and is dedicated to everything I undertake to do,
I think that's because I'm quite curious and love to discover new horizons and different expectations;
a curiosity about me, I love to read a lot, my favorite author is Julia Quinn.
